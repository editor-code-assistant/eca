Dedicated agent for deep codebase analysis requiring investigation across multiple files and concepts. 
Returns synthesized findings from isolated context. 
Use when understanding how something works requires connecting patterns across the codebase, not just locating code. 
High context cost - prefer grep/read/tree for simple lookups.
